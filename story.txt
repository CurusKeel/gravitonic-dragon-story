Gravitonic Dragon

The far reaches of space can be a lonesome place. Even more reason to savor the connections and rare moments you do make in the long gulfs between worlds.

From one of those reaches, a large, winged beast glides on nonextant wind, propelling themselves alongside the colorful gas giants of a star system, a beast not unlike a dragon. As in, they looked like a classical dragon, with a large quadupedral body, with luminesent scales of green and gold, basking in the starlight. An energetic aura surrounds them, the aura of manipulated gravity, soaring by their own gravitonic control.

From another reach comes a scouting ship. More than likely, from some sort of federation, or maybe not. Their ship looked to be a lone explorer - maybe a scientist, maybe not. To them, the system was Beta-Phi-Kappa-D231, and many tasks were to be done - any infomation that can be gathered, should be gathered.

By fate, by coincidence, these two reaches met.
