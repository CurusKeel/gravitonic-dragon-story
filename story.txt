Gravitonic Dragon

The far reaches of space can be a lonesome place. Even more reason to savor the connections and rare moments you do make in the long gulfs between worlds.

From one of those reaches, a large, winged beast glides on nonextant wind, propelling themselves alongside the colorful gas giants of a star system, a beast not unlike a dragon. As in, they looked like a classical dragon, with a large quadupedral body, with luminesent scales of green and gold, basking in the starlight. An energetic aura surrounds them, the aura of manipulated gravity, soaring by their own gravitonic control.

From another reach comes a scouting ship. More than likely, from some sort of federation, or maybe not. Their ship looked to be a lone explorer - maybe a scientist, maybe not. To them, the system was Beta-Phi-Kappa-D231, and many tasks were to be done - any infomation that can be gathered, should be gathered.

By fate, by coincidence, these two reaches met.


The ship traveled forward, begining to make out a blur in the distance. Whatever it was, it was not charted in the navigation maps. Perhaps some lonesome astroid or forgotten planet. However, the crew then seemed to take notice that it was moving. And not aimlessly, but right towards them. 

The crew however, was not too concered as they were part using a high end, latest model military grade vehilcle. Their curiosity took hold and they moved closer to both chart and understand this object.

They soon realized that it was no moon. It was an animal, and not just any animal but dragon. What was curiosity soon became fear. They began to turn around only to find that the dragon's gravitational pull was dragging them back down...
